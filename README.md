# ChatRoom 

development of a chatroom in c with sockets and threads, which makes broadcast messages to everyone who is connected, as well as enqueues those who exceed the allowed limit, the encryption method for a dedicated message is something simple like adding +1 to the characters and subtract them when decrypting.

The code compiles with gcc filename.c -o filename and executes ./filename serverport and for the client ./filename ip serverport
